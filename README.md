# multidimwelfare-scenarios

# For the dimensions of welfare, the first one always has to be of money-metric type (like consumption or gdp)
# Todos: 
 - check computation of welfare metric
 - check that minima and maxima make sense
 - plot the data and check for consistency
 - implement more flexibly weighting scenarios
 
# Issues:
 - for the HDI, income is in PPP, we now use consumption which seems to be in MER. Should we go to income (which is in International US) or retrieve rates to compute PPP consumption?
